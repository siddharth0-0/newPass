# PasswordGen

A simple password generator app built with Angular.

## Features

- Customize the number of characters
- Include or exclude alphabet, numbers, and special characters
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard
- Generate a new password

## Assumptions

- Should be able to generate a password with at least 4 characters
- Should at least have one type of character selected
- Character count can never be 0 or null
- Should have basic functionality of copy generated password

## Future Improvements

- Better UI/UX
- To help personalize the password, add a input for the user to add a personal message or date to the password, which can be helpful for remembering the password.

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.5.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
